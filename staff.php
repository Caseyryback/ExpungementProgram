				<p class="text-light">Karen found it necessary to reinvent herself in the beginning of the 2000's and decided to go back to school.  She has always been interested in the Criminal Justice System in the United States as well as other countries.  She saw that there have been and are many roadblocks in society that prevent ex-offenders from living full, productive lives and so she decided to do something to help remove the stigma and change lives.  In 2008, she went back to school and earned Degrees to help her on this chosen journey. The appreciation, relief and joy displayed by our clients, makes all worthwhile.</p>
